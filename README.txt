Demo for Stack Overflow question #8552428 about XML based generation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Note! This is local abstraction as of now, so that it demonstrates the local case
- The abstraction can be changed to "shared" simply modifying the Options.xml file

- To get to test this simply initialize first the basic abstraction-stack

1. git clone git://github.com/abstractiondev/absInitializer.git SODemo
2. cd SODemo
3. initialize.cmd
4. *Open Visual Studio solution and see that it sees the projects
5. gitaddsub.cmd DemoSOCase8552428ABS
6. gitupdateproject.cmd
7. *Add existing project under DemoSOCase... to solution

Good to go.
